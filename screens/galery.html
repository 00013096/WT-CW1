                <h2>Di Abdulazizova</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Cool learning center. I've been going there for a few months, the teachers are great. There is online
                tracking of results, additional materials for studying, a peaking club and so on. For 4 months of
                training there is a real result, there is an interest in learning languages</p>

                <h2>Makhliyo Akramova</h2>
            </div>
            <p>One of the most popular English language centers in the city. Teaching children and adults. Youth
                oriented. They are active on their social networks. Trained by some of the best and most qualified
                teachers. Due to the popularity of the center, it is very difficult to get there. Personally, I have
                been studying there for two years, with interruptions. Only good learning experience. The only thing I
                can notice is that the guard near the entrance is always very serious</p>

                <h2>Roman Radjapov</h2>
            </div>
            <p>An excellent center for learning English: the teachers are all competent, they know how to explain the
                topic, they answer questions, the prices for training are average for the market. I am especially
                pleased that there is a second teacher (academic support) who will help you understand those topics that
                you did not understand. Training is conducted in both Russian and Uzbek. Also, teachers themselves speak
                English in class and encourage students to do the same. Lessons are very interesting.</p>
